## Introduction
   
This report provides an overview of student engagement and performance at Tech Studio Academy between 2024 and 2025.
The aim is to understand overall enrolment trends, course success rates, revenue outcomes, and student satisfaction to help guide strategic decision-making.


## Business Understanding

Tech Studio Academy aims to deliver high impact tech education across Nigeria through diverse programs such as Product Design, Cyber Security, Data Analysis, and Full Stack Web Development.
This project was initiated to evaluate the academy’s performance across key dimensions enrollment trends, student satisfaction,
course completion, and revenue generation to support data driven decision making.


## Business Goal

The primary goal of this project is to leverage data analytics to evaluate and enhance the performance of Tech Studio Academy. 
By transforming raw educational data into actionable insights, the academy aims to:

* Identify high-performing courses and regions for strategic growth
* Improve student satisfaction and completion rates
* Optimize revenue generation across programs
* Support data-driven decisions to elevate learning outcomes and operational efficiency
This initiative empowers stakeholders to make informed choices that drive sustainable growth and educational impact.


## Analysis and Key Insights

Key findings include:
Strong year on year enrolment growth.

* Year on Year Enrollment Trends: 2024 saw higher enrollment than 2025, with a noticeable drop from ~90 to ~60 students.
While the overall total enrollment is 150, the downward trend in 2025 suggests a need to investigate potential causes such as market saturation, competition, or changes in course offerings.

* Course Popularity: Product Design and Cyber Security are the most popular courses, attracting ~50 and ~40 enrollments respectively.
Data Analysis and Full Stack Web Development trail behind, with ~30 and ~20 enrollments.
This indicates a strong demand for design and security skills, possibly reflecting industry trends or student career preferences.

* City Level Enrollment Distribution
Cities like Port Harcourt, Lagos, and Abuja dominate in enrollment numbers, as shown by larger bubbles on the map.
These urban centers likely benefit from better infrastructure, higher population density, and stronger tech ecosystems.

* Satisfaction and Completion Outcomes
The overall completion rate is 81.33%, which is quite strong.
However, average satisfaction is only 7.18 out of 10, and varies significantly by course:
Full Stack Web Development: ~5
Cyber Security: ~4
Data Analysis: ~3
Product Design: ~2
This suggests that while students are completing courses, their experience especially in Product Design is not meeting expectations.

* Revenue Contribution by Course
Cyber Security leads in revenue (~10M), followed by Full Stack Web Development (~9M).
Product Design and Data Analysis contribute ~7M and ~6M respectively.
Interestingly, Product Design has high enrollment but lower satisfaction and revenue,
while Full Stack Web Development has fewer students but higher revenue and satisfaction indicating better monetization and delivery quality.


## Summary of Findings

The analysis of Tech Studio Academy’s performance data revealed several key insights:

* Enrollment Trends: Strong overall enrollment with a slight decline from 2024 to 2025, indicating potential market shifts or saturation.
  
* Course Popularity: Product Design and Cyber Security emerged as the most enrolled programs, reflecting current industry demand.
  
* Geographic Concentration: Major cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt accounted for the highest share of enrollments.
  
* Satisfaction & Completion: Completion rates were high (81.33%), but satisfaction scores varied significantly across courses, suggesting areas for instructional improvement.
  
* Revenue Distribution: Cyber Security and Full Stack Web Development generated the most revenue, while other courses showed potential for pricing or value optimization.
  
These findings provide a data-driven foundation for strategic decisions in program expansion, quality enhancement, and resource allocation.




## Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

* Expand high-demand courses in top-performing cities.
Tech Studio Academy should consider increasing its Product Design and Cyber Security program capacity such as adding more class sessions, offering advanced modules, or allocating more trainers in Abuja and Lagos, where demand is proven to be strongest. These cities present the highest potential for growth and the best return on investment. 
For Port Harcourt, the academy could maintain or slightly scale its offerings, while Ibadan might benefit from targeted marketing or awareness campaigns to boost enrolment.

* Improve support in courses with lower satisfaction or completion rates.
 Why: Courses like Product Design and Data Analysis have lower satisfaction scores and may risk higher dropout rates.
Action: Conduct student feedback sessions, revise curriculum content, provide additional mentoring, and improve instructor training.
Impact: Enhancing the learning experience will boost satisfaction, increase completion rates, and improve the academy’s reputation.

* Optimize pricing or discount strategies for courses with low net revenue.
Why: Despite decent enrollment, some courses (e.g., Data Analysis) generate less revenue, possibly due to pricing misalignment or low perceived value.
Action: Reassess pricing models, introduce tiered packages, offer limited-time discounts, or bundle courses to increase value perception.
Impact: This can improve profitability without compromising accessibility, especially for courses with growth potential.

* Strengthen career-support initiatives to improve employment outcomes.
Why: Completion alone isn’t enough students expect tangible career outcomes post-training.
Action: Expand job placement services, build partnerships with tech companies, offer resume workshops, mock interviews, and alumni networking.
Impact: Stronger career outcomes will enhance student satisfaction, attract new enrollments, and reinforce the academy’s value proposition.


## Conclusion

Between 2024 and 2025, Tech Studio Academy demonstrated solid overall performance, marked by healthy enrollment figures, strong completion rates, and meaningful revenue generation.
The data reveals distinct patterns across courses, cities, and delivery modes that offer actionable opportunities for strategic growth.
High-demand programs and top-performing cities present clear avenues for expansion, while disparities in satisfaction and revenue across courses highlight areas for targeted improvement.
The strong link between student satisfaction, completion rates, and potential employment outcomes underscores the importance of enhancing the learning experience and career support services.
By leveraging these insights, the academy is well-positioned to scale its most successful offerings, optimize resource allocation, and elevate its impact on learners and the broader tech ecosystem.
